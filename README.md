Furnace
=============

Furnace is an web application development framework designed to help you 
rapidly develop your next PHP 5.3+ webapp. As a framework it 
follows a traditional MVC approach. It emphasizes modularity and
code reuse to further reduce the amount of time needed to develop
fully-functional (e.g: not just another blog demo ;) ) applications.

Furnace is made available under the terms of the Apache Software 
License version 2.0, meaning you have extreme flexibility in how and
where you use Furnace. For more details, be sure to see the 
[license](http://furnace.frameworkers.org/license) page.
