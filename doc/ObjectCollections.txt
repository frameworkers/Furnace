FObjectCollection Class
------------------------

The FObjectCollection class is a 'virtual object manager' presenting
to the programmer a flexible object-oriented interface to the access
and manipulation of groups of remote objects. 

Construction
---------
The constructor takes three arguments:
1) $type [string] : Specifies the type of objects in the group.
2) $lookupTable [string] : Specifies the database table to use for 
lookups in the case of a MM relationship. If 1M, $lookupTable is
the table corresponding to the data object specified in $type.
3) $filter [string] : Specifies the primary limiting selection
criteria for group membership.

Notes: Based on the format of $lookupTable (specifically, whether or 
not it contains an "_") the $relationType is set to either "1M" or "MM"

Retrieving Objects
---------
The function get takes four arguments:
1) $uniqueValues [string] : can be one of four possible values:
1a) "*" : Requests all members of the collection
1b) scalar : Represents a value for a single attribute (specified in $key)
for a single member of the group to be returned
1c) numeric_array: Represents an array of values for a single attribute
(specified in $key) for a subset of members of the group to be returned
1d) associative array: Represents a set of attribute=>value pairs to use in
determining the subset of members of the group to be returned
2) $key [string] : Specifies how to interpret $uniqueValues, except in (1d)
where it is the ORDER BY attribute
3) $sortOrder [string] : Specifies how to sort the members of the group
4) $returnType [mixed] : Specifies how to return the results. Can be one of 
three possible values: 
4a) "object" : each member of the result set should be returned as an object.
4b) "collection" : the function should return an FObjectCollection object
with the $filter set so as to select the present subset of objects
4c) numeric_array: an array of object attributes to return. Returned array
will be of the form:
(assume $key = FirstName, returnType=array("Age","Weight"))
array(
  [John] => array(
    [Age] => 28
    [Weight] => 167
  )
  [Larry] => array(
    [Age] => 36
    [Weignt] => 180
  )
)
