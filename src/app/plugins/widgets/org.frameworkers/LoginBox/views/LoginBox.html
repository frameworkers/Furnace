			Developer notice: This message (well, not this part in yellow, just the red bit) will be
			shown to your users whenever the LoginBox widget is not able to connect
			to your database. In production use, this may mean the database is
			temporarily offline, but during development, it usually means you have
			not yet specified your database details in the application config file,
			(/app/config/app.yml) or that you have done so, but there is an error.
