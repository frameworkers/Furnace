FObject Class
------------------------

The FObject class is a PHP representation of a model object.

Construction
---------
The constructor takes a single argument:
1) $data [associative_array] : contains all of the data from the database
for this object instance. data is initialized from the array. In the case
of 

Retrieval
---------
The ::Retrieve function is a static function that takes a single argument:
1) $objId [integer] : the unique ID of this object in the database.
The function queries the database and calls the object class constructor
with the resultant data array.

Creation
---------
The ::Create function is a static function that takes as its arguments
exactly as many elements as are needed to create a unique entry in the 
database. The entry is made and the objId of the entry is retrieved. The
function then makes a call to the object class constructor with a 
data array comprised of the original arguments + the objId.

Saving
---------
Saving is done either in the set* function (with the bSaveImmediately flag
set to TRUE) or in the save function itself. If the object has a valid
objId, then save proceeds to issue UPDATE statements to the appropriate
row in the database table.
