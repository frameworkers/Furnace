# Routes.yml

# Mappings between URLs and Controller/View pairs
# NOTE: Order is important! The Router runs top to bottom, 
# stopping after it has found a route that matches.

## Maintenance URL 
## This is an example of site-wide (global) redirection. This
## type of redirection can be useful in the event that all or
## part of the application is undergoing maintenance. Naturally,
## this route should be the first available route (topmost) in 
## the file. Uncomment the route to activate it. 
#site_down:
#  url: /*
#  map: {controller: _furnace, view: unavailable}

## SITEWIDE DEFAULT ROUTES
## These routes ship with every furnace installation.
## Since they appear at the bottom of the file, they will
## only be matched if every previous rule fails.

default:
  url: /:controller/:view/*

default_index:
  url: /:controller/*
  map: {view: index}

homepage:
